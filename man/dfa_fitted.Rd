\title{Get the fitted values from a DFA as a data frame}
\usage{
dfa_fitted(modelfit, conf_level = 0.95, names = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{modelfit}{Output from \code{\link{fit_dfa}}.}

\item{conf_level}{Probability level for CI.}

\item{names}{Optional vector of names for time series labels. Should be same length as the number of time series.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the following columns: `ID` is an identifier for each time series, `time` is the time step, `y` is the observed values standardized to mean 0 and unit variance, `estimate` is the mean fitted value, `lower` is the lower CI, and `upper` is the upper CI.
